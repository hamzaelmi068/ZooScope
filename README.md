# ZooScope

## Overview
ZooScope is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify animals in a zoo. The application uses a dataset of animals' features to predict their class labels. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of machine learning in real-world applications, specifically in the field of animal identification and conservation. 

Implemented distance functions, including **Hamming, Euclidean, and Jaccard** to evaluate classification accuracy.
