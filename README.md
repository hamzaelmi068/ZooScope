# ZooScope

## Overview
ZooScope is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify animals in a zoo. The application uses a dataset of animals' features to predict their class labels. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of machine learning in real-world applications, specifically in the field of animal identification and conservation.

## Features
- Animal Classification: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify animals into their respective classes based on a set of features.
- Real-Time Predictions: Makes predictions on new data instantly, providing accurate classifications of animals.
- Accuracy Metrics: Provides detailed metrics on the accuracy of the model's predictions, such as Euclidean Algorithm, Jaccards Algorithm, Hammings Algo, etc.
